# project-weather-app-2

We started for 1st design but we decided to switch to 2nd design since we felt a bit unsure about style, what to use and how to use.

We watched youtube videos to guide us to achieve our goals. We used a lot of console.log()'s to see what we get from fetched json.

We collaborated perfectly. We tried to code as much as with comments for us to explain ourselves at each step.
